Thank you for using AutoPre, a PPT automatic filler based on Dynalist note, Word document and so on, targeting on freeing ourselves from the exhausting ppt formating.
Thus, we can focus on the content itself and contribute more valuable outputs.

This is an open source software. It's my great pleasure that my thoughts and works may be of some value.
If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to contact me. The email address is shown upwards.
